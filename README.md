Hi there, I'm Shayekh Mohiuddin Ahmed Navid 👋

🔭 I'm currently working as a Research Assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute IAIS in Sankt Augustin, focusing on evaluating and comparing different optimization strategies for neural networks. Before this, I was a Junior Data Scientist at Bingooo AG in Bonn, where I processed over 3 million data points using PySpark for machine learning, among other things.

🌱 I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Web and Data Science from the University of Koblenz, deepening my knowledge in a field I'm passionate about.

💼 Previously, I've built backend cloud microservices and data pipelines at Deep Data Labs Ltd in Bangladesh, showcasing my skills in cloud technologies and AWS services.

📚 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University and have several certifications, including AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Kaggle's Intro & Intermediate Machine Learning.

👨‍💻 My technical toolkit includes Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript, REST API, SQL, serverless frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, AWS services (S3, EC2, Lambda), Scikit Learn, Linux, Git, and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Keras.

🏆 I've published research on Fingerprint Alteration Classification and Signature Verification using Convolutional Neural Networks, participated in the DeepFake Detection Facebook Challenge, and worked on various projects ranging from loan defaulter prediction to COVID-19 visualization.

📈 I'm passionate about data science, machine learning, and cloud computing, always eager to learn more and tackle new challenges.
