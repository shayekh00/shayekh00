# Hi there, I'm Shayekh 👋

🔭 **Currently:**  
I am a Research Assistant at the **Fraunhofer Institute IAIS** in Sankt Augustin, Germany, where I focus on evaluating and optimizing strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs), including multi-modal systems and advanced neural networks.  

🚀 **AI Engineering:**

Beyond research, I actively engineer and deploy machine learning systems, particularly those involving large language and vision-language models. I have been working on multiple AI workflows projects, from data preprocessing and model fine-tuning to evaluation and deployment using tools like LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face and PyTorch Lightning. Recently I built scalable multi agent-based systems semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation. For me, AI engineering is not just about building models, but designing systems that make these models work efficiently and meaningfully in real contexts.

🌱 **Academics:**  
I am pursuing a Master's in **Web and Data Science** at the University of Koblenz, further deepening my knowledge in machine learning, data science, and modern web technologies.  

💼 **Past Experiences:**  

- **Research Assistant (AI & LLM)** at **Fraunhofer Institute IAIS**: Contributed to end-to-end development of vision-language models, improving VQA performance through multimodal fusion, knowledge distillation, and enhanced scene understanding.
- **Junior Data Scientist** at **Bingooo AG**: Processed millions of data points using PySpark and built machine learning models for regression and prediction tasks.  
- **Data Engineer** at **Deep Data Labs Ltd**: Built scalable backend cloud microservices and data pipelines leveraging AWS services like Lambda, S3, and EC2.  

📚 **Education & Certifications:**  
- Masters in **Web and Data Science** from University of Koblenz.
- Bachelor's in **Computer Science and Engineering** from North South University.  
- Certified **AWS Cloud Practitioner**.  
- Completed Kaggle's Intro & Intermediate Machine Learning courses.  

👨‍💻 **Technical Skills:**  
- Programming: Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript  
- Frameworks & Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn  
- Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda), Serverless Frameworks, CI/CD Pipelines  
- Tools: SQL, REST APIs, Git, Linux, PySpark  

🏆 **Achievements:**  
- Published research on **Fingerprint Alteration Classification** and **Signature Verification** using CNNs.  
- Participated in the **DeepFake Detection Facebook Challenge**.  
- Developed impactful projects, including **loan defaulter prediction**, **COVID-19 data visualization**, and more.  

📈 I am deeply passionate about **data science**, **machine learning**, and **cloud computing**, always seeking to contribute to meaningful projects and explore cutting-edge technologies.
